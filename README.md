# UFOs

## Overview of Project

In this project, I built an HTML page that allows me to pull data from a JavaScript file using filters on the page. There are many different UFO sightings that have occurred throughout the United States, so the filters make it easier for a user to find a sighting based on an area or the type of shape the sighting in question. 

## Software

- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap


## Results

The following image shows the first part of the HTML page that a user will see. There is a general title and opening summary to share about UFOs and the question of existence in our country today.

As you screw down the page, you will see the following image containing the filters and some of the data.

As you can see above, there are are five filters: date, city, state, shape, and country. You can use any of these filters and enter in the search bar, then the HTML page will update to show all of the sightings following that specific search. A user is allowed to enter multiple filters at one time to enhance their searches.

## Summary

This webpage is clean and organized which creates an easy-to-use experience for a user with filtered search bars. One drawback to this design is having everything be on one page. I believe that this can sometimes look clustered and could turn a user away. I have the following two recommendations for improving this website: include a sight that is constantly adding and updating new sightings to our data, and maybe adding another filter regarding the color of the sighting to help.
